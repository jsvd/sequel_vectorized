== sequel_vectorized

* Allows Sequel::Dataset to be exported as an Hash of Arrays and NArrays (http://narray.rubyforge.org)
* Numeric and boolean columns are converted to NArrays. Others are kept as Arrays.
* Aims for bulk numeric data processing

== Example

  TODO

== Installation

	gem install jsvd-sequel_vectorized

== Features/Problems

  * Conversions are currently limited to Numeric => Float, Boolean => byte
  * TODO: optionally pass an Hash of :class => proc to vectorize.
    *  Proc will transform an instance of :class to a NArray usable type (float, byte)
